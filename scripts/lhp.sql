The book begins with early poems from his first collection, <em>Remind Me for the Road,</em> to his most recent works. One of the founding members of the nonconformist literary group known as the<em> Kyiv School of Poetry,</em> early Vorobiov is known for his preoccupation with metaphor and surreal imagery. In his more mature poetry he reveals himself as a master of miniature, with considerable affinity to Japanese haiku where the perception of a fleeting moment constitutes the essence of his poems’ rationale. Nature reigns supreme in Vorobiov’s poetic oeuvre and it provides him with endless opportunity for creating startling images. His intuitive connection to the surrounding environs is so penetrating and organic that his visions, however strange, come across as convincing and justified. There are hardly any references to Ukrainian realities (past or present) in his poetry. Vorobiov’s concerns hover around the issues of existence on all possible levels—plants, animals, humans, inanimate objects, and the universe. The poet is not interested in conveying the past; rather, he trusts his imagination as the ultimate source of creativity. <em>Mountain and Flower</em> attempts to penetrate the invisible that has no beginning and no end, and invites the reader to plunge into this mysterious unknown.</p>\r\n&nbsp;','MOUNTAIN & FLOWER: Selected Poems of Mykola Vorobiov  •  Translated from the Ukrainian by Maria G.

She inherited generations of memories and found an uncommon resolve to record the emotional life of her people, Jews only recently emigrated from Ukraine. Though she might be seen as a documentarian of loss, her voice is not hectoring but elegiac, bringing a ferocious lyricism to what might otherwise be the repressed micro-histories, lost narratives of exile, and heirlooms of desperation and diaspora.

The speaker in these poems is often in a state of not knowing that can be both terrifying and revelatory. It is a state in which windows and doors connect the living and the dead and the inner and outer landscapes. <em>The River People</em> is organized in four sections that move from Florida to the Pacific Northwest. The poems are heavily imagistic and reminiscent of the deep image poetry and Spanish surrealism.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Polly Buckingham’s terse lyrics, semi-biographical journeys and glittering elegies, rich with the surreal fabric of nightmare and dream, open in the mind strange doors through which affection, fear, grief, playfulness, and wonder enter the world. In “Potting Roses,” she tells us: “I suppose this is the peace/after a summer rain/ when mist rises above the roses/and the white faces/of angels dissipate.” <i>The River People </i>offers dozens of such moments, all of them crafted by a mature emotional and technical range rarely found in first collections of poems, and I am grateful that this book now lives and breathes among us.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>—Christopher Howell </i></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s about time a book of Polly Buckingham’s striking poems has come out, to join with her award-winning fiction. The poems have been around for years and are gathered here in a delightful first collection. Although her work falls in with surrealists like Pablo Neruda and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the poems are nailed down by crystal clear imagery. “After You’re Gone” is typical, starting with “I’m standing in the refrigerator light/ pouring water into a blue glass/when a white van pulls up.” In poem after poem, the mystery builds. A fine introduction to an original and serious poet.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>—Peter Meinke</i></p>','The River People','The poems in The River People, Polly Buckingham’s debut collection, move through dream landscapes and natural landscapes exploring connection and loss, abundance and degradation, the personal and the political.','inherit','closed','closed','','4866-autosave-v1','','','',4866,'http://www.losthorsepress.org/4866-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0,1,1),(21,'2020-11-12 16:38:41','2020-11-13 00:38:41','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tami Haaland’s exquisite and necessary book of poems, <em>What Does Not Return,</em> is a rare account of the experience we have come to call, rightly, care-giving. With ritual attentiveness, in small, deeply considered gestures, in words exchanged at the altar of grief, she shows us what it might mean to honor and celebrate what is given to us and what is taken away. From the moving first poems, in which she witnesses her mother’s daily diminishment and eventual death from dementia, to the last, when she finds herself searching silently for an escaped rabbit in the night, these poems remind us that, if we are here, we are all “graveside,” sitting “on the edge, legs dangling.” We are here on the verge of tears, where the daylight is.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>—Melissa Kwasny</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>What Does Not Return</em> is remarkable—pity and common joy intermingling.

We see the entrance of light and the light that remains after the poem is finished, a mother’s life put away. Our life’s story is told, the end especially, with grave dignity. And, as it is with ceremonies, a sense of what is pure also remains, a sense that we are “awake in ways” that we “couldn’t have sustained earlier.”</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>—Carol Frost</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>','WHAT DOES NOT RETURN','\"Tami Haaland’s exquisite and necessary book of poems, What Does Not Return, is a rare account of the experience we have come to call, rightly, care-giving. . . .\"','inherit','closed','closed','','4198-autosave-v1','','','',4198,'http://www.losthorsepress.org/4198-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0,1,1),(22,'2020-11-09 10:16:42','2020-11-09 18:16:42','A link to the ZOOM reading:\r\n\r\n<a title=\"LOST HORSE PRESS Fall 2020 Book Launch Reading\" href=\" https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/GUMhBZRi-YhZVIH4gx_lQIvh7Yo7PAAgtnQVhJQK7v2WARLGH9IVenwpoZHDM37Q.NI99qW_sq-Ev8DLv \" target=\"_blank\">https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/GUMhBZRi-YhZVIH4gx_lQIvh7Yo7PAAgtnQVhJQK7v2WARLGH9IVenwpoZHDM37Q.NI99qW_sq-Ev8DLv</a>\r\n\r\nPasscode: @r7^+I76\r\n\r\nEnjoy!<a href=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/catalog/my-mothers-red-ford-%e2%80%a2-new-selected-poems-1986-2020/mmrf_frcover/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4862\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4862\" alt=\"MMRF_FrCover\" src=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MMRF_FrCover-200x300.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/catalog/the-river-people-%e2%80%a2-polly-buckingham/trp_frcover/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4912\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4912\" alt=\"TRP_FrCover\" src=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TRP_FrCover-250x386.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"386\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/lost-horse-press-fall-2020-book-launch-reading/c_frcover/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4925\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-4925 aligncenter\" alt=\"C_FrCover\" src=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/C_FrCover-250x375.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-4911 alignright\" style=\"text-align: start; caret-color: #000000; color: #000000;\" alt=\"MFCover\" src=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MFCover-250x386.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"386\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>','LOST HORSE PRESS Fall 2020 Book Launch Reading','Join us to celebrate the release of the new Fall 2020 titles from Lost Horse Press, featuring Roy Bentley’s <em>My Mother’s Red Ford: New & Selected Poems 1986 - 2020</em>; Polly Buckingham’s <em>The River People</em>; Svetlana Lavochkina’s <em>Carbon: Song of Crafts</em>; and Mykola Vorobiov’s <em>Mountain & Flower: Selected Poems</em> read by translator Maria G.

While several of the poets have previously had work translated into English, few have had their poetry featured as a book-length volume. Ukrainian poetry is still too rarely translated, and many of these poets remain unknown to a wider audience. The translators of these books will reflect on the collaborative translation process; the themes, sights, and soundscapes captured in their translations; the challenges encountered in translating from a poetic tradition that still relies on rhyme; and the creative solutions found. This session is best served through the roundtable format as after brief presentations of each book, the presenters will engage in discussion led by questions posed by the moderator.</p>\r\nPanel participants include Vitaly Chernetsky, University of Kansas; Roman Ivashkiv, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Ostap Kin, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey; Maria G. Rewakowicz, University of Washington; and Iryna Shuvalova, Independent Scholar\r\n\r\nTo register for the online 20202 ASEEES Convention, go to their website at <a title=\"ASEEES Convention\" href=\"http://https://www.aseees.org/convention\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.aseees.org/convention</a>.','LOST HORSE PRESS at the ASEEES Convention 2020 ','Lost Horse Press Contemporary Ukrainian Poetry Series editor, Grace Mahoney, will manage the roundtable discussion at the 2020 Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) Convention.','publish','closed','closed','','lost-horse-press-at-the-aseees-convention-2020','','','',0,'http://www.losthorsepress.org/?p=4918',0,'post','',0,1,1),(27,'2020-10-13 14:52:22','2020-10-13 21:52:22','Lost Horse Press has been informed that our grant application was evaluated by the Expert Council and recommended for support under the Ukrainian Book Institute grant program, Translate Ukraine.

These are the poems of the heavy-lifters, night-shifters, line and piece workers, writing with grace and often with humor: poets who punch clocks, <i>woman</i> the phones and decks, weave, weld and can, cotton-pick and cold call, thread-spin, typeset and teach. They sex-work, they ship-build, plaster and preach, butcher and drive the bus. This is anthology as page-turner, as fist in the air, as do-it-yourself manual against despair. Here, and in gratitude to Lily Ledbetter, is the music of a movement, and it is one of the best of our time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em> —Carolyn Forché </em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In January 2009, after President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law, his first legislative act after taking office, poets Carolyne Wright and Eugenia Toledo began to think about the need to hear more from women about their workplace experiences—not just pay and promotion inequity, or workplace harassment and intimidation, but all matters relevant to women and work in an increasingly globalized world, including the ever-widening range of occupations in which women are engaged, and their joy and satisfaction of work well done.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Six years after the signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, however, women’s pay has continued to average 77 cents for every dollar earned by men; pay for women of color has averaged even lower. Despite the activism of the Occupy Movement, more congressional legislation for women’s pay, and a rising minimum wage in many states, women’s overall pay continues to lag, even at the highest levels of elite careers!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Meanwhile, Wright and Toledo, along with co-editor M. L. Lyons, set out to edit an anthology of poetry about women in the workplace, knowing that it would be a daunting, yet important task. They hoped to bring together voices of women poets in the workspaces they occupy—much as Studs Terkel illuminated the lives of working people in his interviews, as Woody Guthrie celebrated in song, and as the iconic Mary Harris “Mother” Jones (at one time called “the most dangerous woman in America”) fought for in labor strikes, union organizing, and a seminal autobiography. Wright, Lyons and Toledo have brought together voices of women poets in the workspaces they occupy: from cotton rows to corner suites, trawlers to typing pools, nursing stations to space stations, factory floors to faculty offices. These voices bear witness to women’s workplace lives, and act to re-envision and refigure the world of work for women.</p>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FrCover72.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3189\" alt=\"FrCover72\" src=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FrCover72-720x1024.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"717\" /></a></em><em> </em>','RAISING LILLY LEDBETTER: Women Poets Occupy the Workspace','','inherit','closed','closed','','3147-revision-v1','','','',3147,'http://www.losthorsepress.org/3147-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0,1,1),(31,'2020-09-23 18:13:23','2020-09-24 01:13:23','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AuthorPhoto.tif\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4867\" alt=\"AuthorPhoto\" src=\"http://www.losthorsepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AuthorPhoto.tif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></a>The poems in <em>The River People,</em> Polly Buckingham’s debut collection, move through dream landscapes and natural landscapes exploring connection and loss, abundance and degradation, the personal and the political. The speaker in these poems is often in a state of not knowing that can be both terrifying and revelatory. It is a state in which windows and doors connect the living and the dead and the inner and outer landscapes. <em>The River People</em> is organized in four sections that move from Florida to the Pacific Northwest. The poems are heavily imagistic and reminiscent of the deep image poetry and Spanish surrealism.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Polly Buckingham’s terse lyrics, semi-biographical journeys and glittering elegies, rich with the surreal fabric of nightmare and dream, open in the mind strange doors through which affection, fear, grief, playfulness, and wonder enter the world. In “Potting Roses,” she tells us: “I suppose this is the peace/after a summer rain/ when mist rises above the roses/and the white faces/of angels dissipate.” <i>The River People </i>offers dozens of such moments, all of them crafted by a mature emotional and technical range rarely found in first collections of poems, and I am grateful that this book now lives and breathes among us.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>—Christopher Howell </i></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s about time a book of Polly Buckingham’s striking poems has come out, to join with her award-winning fiction. The poems have been around for years and are gathered here in a delightful first collection. Although her work falls in with surrealists like Pablo Neruda and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the poems are nailed down by crystal clear imagery. “After You’re Gone” is typical, starting with “I’m standing in the refrigerator light/ pouring water into a blue glass/when a white van pulls up.” In poem after poem, the mystery builds. A fine introduction to an original and serious poet.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>—Peter Meinke</i></p>','The River People','The poems in The River People, Polly Buckingham’s debut collection, move through dream landscapes and natural landscapes exploring connection and loss, abundance and degradation, the personal and the political.','publish','closed','closed','','the-river-people-%e2%80%a2-polly-buckingham','','','',0,'http://www.losthorsepress.org/?post_type=catalog&#038;p=4866',0,'catalog','',0,1,1),(32,'2020-09-23 15:36:36','2020-09-23 22:36:36','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ROY BENTLEY’S <i>My Mother’s Red Ford: New &amp; Selected Poems </i>1986 - 2020 represents his first six books, four of which won or distinguished themselves in national competitions.

We believe that intent to act ethically, clarity of guidelines, and transparency of process form the foundation of an ethical contest. To that end, we agree to 1) conduct our contests as ethically as possible and to address any unethical behavior on the part of our readers, judges, or editors; 2) to provide clear and specific contest guidelines—defining conflict of interest for all parties involved; and 3) to make the mechanics of our selection process available to the public. This Code recognizes that different contest models produce different results, but that each model can be run ethically.

Christine Holbert, founder and publisher of Lost Horse Press, earned her publishing degree from Eastern Washington University in 1998. At that time, she realized that few independent presses in the region could afford to hire a full-time editor or book designer. She understood that the place to pursue a serious publishing career was New York, but since she didn’t want to live in the City, Holbert decided to found a literary press so she could have a job. And live in the country. So, in June 1998, she established Lost Horse Press in her home south of Spokane, Washington. </p><p>Holbert and the Press moved to Sandpoint, to a Mennonite-built log cabin in the Sunnyside area, in 1999. There — by the shores of 43-mile-long Lake Pend Oreille — Christine reviews and edits manuscripts, designs covers and text, typesets books, designs catalogs, promotes Lost Horse books, manages marketing, oversees interns and volunteers, and negotiates with distributors, bookstores, printers, authors, and other publishers. Christine Holbert has guided to completion such outstanding titles as <em>Love</em> by Valerie Martin, <em>Composing Voices: A Cycle of Dramatic Monologues</em> by Robert Pack, <em>Thistle</em> by Melissa Kwasny, <em>Woman on the Cross</em> and <em>Tales of a Dalai Lama</em> by Pierre Delattre, <em>Just Waking</em> by Christopher Howell, <em>The Baseball Field at Night</em> by Patricia Goedicke, and <em>A Change of Maps</em> by Carolyne Wright, among others. In the first fourteen years of existence, the Press published fifty-three books of poetry and twelve fiction titles, many of which have won national awards.</p><p>The<em> Lost Horse Series for Emerging Writers</em> is dedicated to publishing and promoting the early books of deserving authors whose work is ignored by conglomerate publishers who require their authors to already have an established audience. Emerging writers — especially poets — have few publishing houses willing to advocate their work. Few publishers will take the literary or the financial risk to publish an unknown author whose work may not sell well. Lost Horse Press has published eight previously unknown poets and writers. One such title, Scott Poole’s <em>The Cheap Seats</em>, has won two national book awards. </p><p>In 2006, Lost Horse Press teamed up with poet, Marvin Bell, to introduce a new series for emerging poets, <em>New Poets | Short Books</em>. \"The idea for this series is indebted to <em>Poets of Today,</em> the Scribner series edited by John Hall Wheelock from 1954 to 1962, which published in eight volumes first books by twenty-four poets, three poets at a time under a single cover. . . . The increased promotion in recent years of American poetry on many levels owes much to a dumbing-down of the art and the proliferation of novelty acts. Yet the country is also chock-full of little-published poets of higher seriousness. This 3-in-1 series, then, is intended to sample a range of poets who have yet to publish a book and have generally gone about their writing in private. It will not be run as a contest, nor will it accept submissions.\" Volume IV will be released in February 2010.</p><p>In addition to running the Press, Holbert is dedicated to contributing to the community: She organizes creative writing workshops, an annual writing conference for adults, literary readings, and an annual book contest—<em>The Idaho Prize for Poetry</em>—to promote the literary arts in Idaho and nationally. In 2001, Lost Horse Press and the East Bonner County Library introduced a program—<em>Young Writers of the Lost Horse</em>—to help children in elementary through high school strengthen their writing skills and heighten their interest in writing. These workshops are provided at no charge to Bonner County students, and are designed to give children from grades 5 through 12 a fresh perspective on the process and pleasure of writing.</p><p><em>The Idaho Prize,</em> established by Lost Horse Press in 2004, is an annual national poetry competition offering prize money plus publication for a book-length manuscript. The 2004 contest was judged by poet Marvin Bell. The winner of the first annual Idaho Prize is poet Alvin Greenberg of Boise, Idaho with his manuscript Hurry Back. Mr. Greenberg’s book was released in December 2004. Melissa Kwasny’s <em>Thistle</em> won the 2005 Idaho Prize for Poetry. Her book is currently available from LHP and from our distributor, the University of Washington Press.</p><p>Lost Horse Press sponsors the annual <em>Lost Horse Writers’ Conference,</em> a literary celebration bringing together readers, scholars, and writers for three days of intensive creative writing workshops, readings by regionally and nationally distinguished writers, lectures, panel discussions, book signings, collaborative presentations, and intimate literary discussions. No other program of this scope exists in north Idaho, benefiting the experienced writer and the neophyte, as well as the ardent reader of contemporary Northwest literature. </p><p>Since 2000, the <em>Lost Horse Writers’ Conference</em> has presented free public readings featuring nationally celebrated writers such as Marvin Bell, Marilynne Robinson, Pamela White Hadas, William Kittredge, Annick Smith, Rick Bass, Quincy Troupe, John Keeble, Claire Davis, Kim Barnes, Dow Mossman, Pierre Delattre, Carlos Reyes, James Grabill, Christopher Howell, Scott Poole, Greg Glazner and many others who have distinguished the stages of Oden Hall and The Panida Theater. Additionally, Holbert has invited world-class musicians to Sandpoint—to collaborate with writers and poets on stage—including jazz bassists Ron Carter and Glen Moore, as well as Sandpoint’s classical guitarist, Leon Atkinson.</p><p>At this time, Christine is building a studio for Lost Horse Press, a timber-frame building that will also accommodate Lost Horse Press’s 1896 Chandler &amp; Price platen press on which broadsides and chapbooks will be printed.</p><p>When she is designing books, Christine is inspired by the following poem by Anne Bradstreet. The first published poet in America, Anne Bradstreet was a Puritan mother of eight children. Her poem ’The Author to Her Book’ was written in response to an edition of her collection <em>The Tenth Muse</em>, which was published without her consent or knowledge. Even though publishing has changed much since Bradstreet penned her poem in the 1600s, some things don’t change: all poets are anxious about how their book will look and how it will be received by the world.</p><blockquote><h2>The Author to Her Book</h2><p>by Anne Bradstreet</p><p>Thou ill-formed offspring of my feeble brain,<br/>Who after birth didst by my side remain,<br/>Till snatched from thence by friends, less wise than true,<br/>Who thee abroad, exposed to public view,<br/>Made thee in rags, halting to th’ press to trudge,<br/>Where errors were not lessened (all may judge).<br/>At thy return my blushing was not small,<br/>My rambling brat (in print) should mother call,<br/>I cast thee by as one unfit for light,<br/>The visage was so irksome in my sight;<br/>Yet being mine own, at length affection would<br/>Thy blemishes amend, if so I could.<br/>I washed thy face, but more defects I saw,<br/>And rubbing off a spot still made a flaw.<br/>I stretched thy joints to make thee even feet,<br/>Yet still thou run’st more hobbling than is meet;<br/>In better dress to trim thee was my mind,<br/>But nought save homespun cloth i’ th’ house I find.<br/>In this array ’mongst vulgars may’st thou roam.<br/>In critic’s hands beware thou dost not come,<br/>And take thy way where yet thou art not known;<br/>If for thy father asked, say thou hadst none;<br/>And for thy mother, she alas is poor,<br/>Which caused her thus to send thee out of door.<br/></p>','<p>Based in Sandpoint, Idaho, Lost Horse Press is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, independent press that publishes poetry titles of high literary merit, and makes available fine contemporary literature through cultural, educational and publishing programs and activities.

Woman has Made Literary Festival Into a Five Day Extravaganza</h2>\nBy Dan Webster, Staff writer\nOctober 3, 2000\n<strong><em>The Spokesman Review</em>, Section: </strong>IN LIFE\n<p>Only a poet would use the word “vortex” in a sentence.</p><p>A poet or a physicist.</p><p>Christine Holbert is neither. She is, however, a publisher of poets.</p><p>And as one of the primary forces behind <strong>Get Lit</strong>!, Eastern Washington University’s third annual literary festival, she’s not unlike physics itself. Because when it comes to promoting Inland Northwest literature—indeed, literature period—Holbert is energy epitomized.</p><p>It’s been largely through Holbert’s efforts that, in just three years, <strong>Get Lit</strong>! Has grown from a mere one-day round of readings at The Met to a full five-day affair held at nine different locations.</p><p>Highlights of this year’s <strong>festival</strong> include Wednesday’s showing of the movie “Jesus’ Son,” which is adapted from Bonners Ferry writer Denis Johnson’s book; Thursday’s appearance by award-winning poet Quincy Troupe at EWU’s Showalter Auditorium; Saturday’s poetry slam at Mootsy’s tavern; and Sunday’s grand finale lineup of such distinguished poets and writers as Kim Barnes, William Kittredge, Claire Davis and, again, Johnson.</p><p>In between there are poetry and fiction readings, children’s events, at least one panel discussion and a closing night open-mike event.</p><p>Not that Holbert has done it alone. She belongs to a team of professionals and volunteers that includes Christopher Howell and Scott Poole, director and co-director of the EWU Press, both of whom are editors and poets with impeccable credentials.</p><p>And the <strong>festival</strong> <strong>gets</strong> plenty of local support from area businesses (including Metropolitan Mortgage, owner of The Met; Hotel Lusso and Auntie’s Bookstore), not to mention the numerous grants that have come in from various sources ($7,000 alone from the Washington Commission for the Humanities).</p><p>But it wouldn’t be unfair to say that, like Reggie Jackson and the 1977 New York Yankees, Holbert is the straw that stirs the drink. Holbert, after all, wrote the grant applications.</p><p>Poole is one of her biggest fans.</p><p>“She’s totally invaluable,” he says. “She has a way of getting people excited about a <strong>festival</strong>, not only promoting the idea of it, but getting people enthused.”</p><p>In Poole’s view, Holbert, whose title is <strong>Get Lit</strong>! coordinator, was key “not only in helping everyone envision what the event could be but also in putting all the pieces together to make it a reality.</p><p>“Without that,” he says, “this would never have happened.”</p><p>That’s high praise for someone who, not that many years ago, was busy raising three children and indulging her love of literature mostly by reading it. As her children got older, Holbert says, “I started looking for interests of my own. And literature was it.”</p><p>The New York native returned to school, finishing up the undergraduate work at EWU that she’d begun years before at SUNY Stony Brook. She continued on to earn a master’s degree at EWU in publishing.</p><p>It was while she was in graduate school, serving as managing editor of the EWU Press, that she knew she’d found her calling. She wanted a press of her own.</p><p>“But I didn’t want to leave the area,’” she says, “and there are not many small presses around. So one day I just decided to do it.”</p><p>By “it” Holbert means creating Lost Horse Press. Funded initially by Holbert herself, the press is her attempt to explore the kind of literaryfiction that most interests her. If she can convert it to nonprofit status, she says, she’ll be able to do in print what <strong>Get Lit</strong>! does in person: continue spotlighting regional writers and poets.</p><p>“Rather than move to where the publishing was,” she says, “I got together with Scott and decided to make this area a <strong>literary</strong> vortex”—there’s that word—“and I think that with <strong>Get</strong> <strong>Lit</strong>!, and with the reception that Lost Horse Press books have had, we’re on our way.’”</p><p>Of the six books that Lost Horse has in print (six more are on the way), three of the authors are scheduled to perform at <strong>Get Lit</strong>! - Howell <em>(Through Silence: The Ling Wei Texts),</em> Poole <em>(Cheap Seats)</em> and Spokane poet, Tom Davis <em>(The Little Spokane).</em></p><p>That trio joins a distinguished group that features two-time American Book Award winner Troupe and a group of Montana writers, including Kittredge, Deirdre McNamer, Annick Smith and James Crumley.</p><p>Holbert is particularly proud of attracting Troupe, a nationally known poet from La Jolla, Calif. A friend of EWU creative writing professor and novelist John Keeble, Troupe represents what <strong>Get Lit</strong>!’s founders hope it will become: an event that promotes literature from the Inland Northwest while bringing the best literature to it.</p><p>So far, because of the connections of such locals as Howell and Keeble, the festival is doing just that.</p><p>“The first year we were lucky to get really good writers because of the people we knew,” Holbert says. “Now I have people asking me if they can come.”</p><p>One of those is Idaho novelist Johnson.</p><p>“He never wants to go anywhere; he never wants to talk to anyone,” Holbert says. “And yet he calls and says, ‘I’m ready to come. When is it, this October? I need to go to Paris, but I’ll schedule that around <strong>Get Lit</strong>!’”</p><p>The upshot of all this is obvious. If nothing else, it proves that Holbert and <strong>Get Lit</strong>! have good—dare we say it?—chemistry.</p>','<p>Only a poet would use the word “vortex” in a sentence.</p><p>A poet or a physicist.</p><p>Christine Holbert is neither.

We knew people were outraged, saddened, profoundly moved and ashamed. But we also wanted to reach people who had suffered violations of their own rights from circumstances across the globe, or whose families had, or for whom preventing or healing these violations had become a life\'s work. We drafted our call loosely: We are increasingly witness to torture, terrorisms and other violations of human rights at unprecedented degrees. What do our instincts tell us and what is our response to these violations? What is our vision of a future wherein human rights are not only respected but expanded? What we received were both first hand accounts of violation—see prisoner Adrian English\'s \"Raped Man\'s Stream of Consciousness,\" or Farnoosh Moshiri\'s poem recounting the terror of giving birth in Iran, or Li-Young Lee\'s \"Self-Help for Fellow Refugees\"—and responses from people who feel struck personally by the blows enacted on others: To speak for, to speak as, and to speak against. We were surprised at the range of issues spoken to by the poets. While torture remained a critical topic, as well as issues at stake in the Iraq War, there were also poems that addressed immigrant rights, prisoners\' rights, the Holocaust, the wars in Cambodia, Vietnam, Serbia, South America, Palestine and Israel. We received poems that spoke of suicide bombing, violence against women, the aftermath of 9/11, and outlawing marriage for gay Americans.</p><p>We were also moved at the range of experience among the responders: homeless advocates, civil rights workers, clinical social workers, medics, the mentally ill, veterans, humanitarian aid workers, teachers, conscientious objectors, and, of course, many writers who work and fight daily for social justice in their communities. We are particularly proud of the number of Native American poets included in this anthology, something unusual in anthologies of this sort. It seemed to us impossible to collect a group of poems on human rights issues if we didn\'t acknowledge the far reaching and often appalling violations that have taken place in our own country, upon the first citizens of this land who belong to five-hundred-sixty-two federally recognized tribes who function as sovereign nations. It is the acknowledgement of this history, among others, that will allow us to move forward as a country with a clearer conscience, extending our hand to other nations and other peoples who continue to endure neglect and abuse.','Melissa Kwasny &amp; M.L.

In each of the poems a single person is talking to one other person to whom he is intimately related, creating deep dramatic tension: a father talking to a bereaved daughter or puzzled son; a sister confronting a sister gone astray or a brother to whom she is confessing her compromised pregnancy; husbands and wives, old and young, reviewing some crisis of their lives together. Combined with these human dramas are the dramas of nature. Pack inherits Robert Frost\'s sensitivity to the minutiae of spectacle and evolution, the mysteries of God and Darwin\'s theories. He regards these with humor and compassion. And, perhaps miraculously, but surely most wisely, he does it all within the regulations and beauties of blank verse.</p>\r\n<p>Pack has added to his first cycle of monologues some characters who are not necessarily related by blood. Here we find relations of professional intimacy—lawyer and client, doctor and patient.

All these characters are, of course, the creations of a single mind, that of the author\'s.

I felt that each story was a visit to a different room in the house of the soul (though there are doors between the rooms and influences move from one to another). Passanante\'s writing is sensuous, in its concreteness, its imagery, and the descriptions of sensation and feeling. It is also precise--I never found an unnecessary or a not-quite-right word. The characters are sexual, and Passanate\'s writing is wonderfully honest about the complexity of sexual feeling and expression. Sexuality is also their medium of expression, and the complexity of experience is reflected in the complexity of the characters\' sexual feeling and behavior. There is much wit, and there is also tragedy. This is one of those writers who, even in her more gothic moments, describes a human being in a way that makes you recognize, sometimes reluctantly, some secret in yourself.\r\n\r\nThere\'s wit, variety, and imaginative boldness in this collection of stories, as well as a pleasurable richness of detail that captures different social, geographical, and natural environments with precision and grace. That attunement to place--whether the nursery downstairs from the Middle America bowling lanes or the TriBeCa restaurant with its trendy menu-of-the-minute--conveys not only the world these characters inhabit, but their consuming, poignant hunger. Though the overt subject of most of these stories is passion that transgresses the boundaries of marriage and of other familial and professional codes, what the characters act out in surprising, creative, and sometimes terrifying ways are the hopes and unforeseen consequences of the post-war suburban dream of the perfect place, the home that will satisfy every need and settle all questions. Children of the migrations that brought their grandparents from Europe and their parents from the city, Passanante\'s characters, planted in an Eden meant to end desire, find themselves dreaming of other places, of cities, of the East (whether Boston or India), of transient apartments and hotels--and of other houses, houses that, no matter how familiar their mass-produced design, might just become, contain, or conceal some unknown and absolutely necessary secret ungraspable at home--perhaps that life unlived while the dreamers passed their own youth in striving to act out their parents\' dreams. So these transgressive characters break into houses, or break through their own walls with power tools--and, when they can\'t do either, peer in from the wrong side of nighttime windows. For readers, these stories themselves are windows onto the unspoken reality behind the cultural promises of that time, revealing the often violent and always irreducible mystery of injustice haunting those model homes, compelling the children who grew up in them to betrayals that may only be efforts to make some sense of a guilt that precedes any crime: the guilt of being human.','','Joy Passanante','978-0-9717265-4-3',NULL,'fiction','16.95',NULL,NULL,NULL,'>Joy \r\n            Passanante is the Associate Director of Creative Writing at the University \r\n            of Idaho.

Through the words of both established and up-and-coming poets and prose writers, this collection offers unique insights into a hidden but essential aspect of the contemporary American writing community. Of a Monstrous Child invites men and women from broad backgrounds to articulate the intricacies, injuries, and rewards of the often bizarre, but always human, complicity that is the creative writing mentorship.','','','978-0-9844510-4-3',NULL,'anthology','24.00',NULL,NULL,'Nate Liederbach &amp; James Harris','Contributors include: Ryan Boudinot &amp; Rick Moody,\r\nGrace Bauer &amp; Zachary Schomburg,\r\nDiana Joseph &amp; Melanie Rae Thon,\r\nAmy Hempel &amp; Samuel Ligon,\r\nLee Ann Roripaugh &amp; Pen Pearson,\r\nFrank Soos &amp; David Crouse,\r\nRobin Hemley &amp; Contessa Riggs,\r\nGeorge Looney &amp; Art Zilleruelo,\r\nElizabeth Stuckey-French &amp; Dawn Barron,\r\nSamara Seibel &amp; Gillian Conoley,\r\nBrian Evenson &amp; Alan Tinkler,\r\nChristopher John Williams &amp; Leslie Woodard,\r\nDerick Burleson &amp; Robert Wrigley','of-a-monstrous-child',424,'5.5','8.5',1),(45,'Oyster Perpetual','Austin LaGrone has written a first book of exceptional singularity, wholeness, and focus of vision. He can be playful and tragic. His poems are deadly serious, even when they are funny, and he is unafraid of being understood. He is also unafraid of making fun of\r\nhimself (or his persona) because he understands he is part of the great human joyful mess. He sings from right in the middle of it, he praises, he satirizes, his heart is broken yet he, his poems, still have hope.','Thomas Lux','Austin LaGrone','978-0-9844510-6-7',NULL,'poetry','18.00','21.00',NULL,NULL,'Austin LaGrone was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
