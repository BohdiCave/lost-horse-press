At the same time, no one else contemplates broncs, Chinook winds, the Wolf Teeth Mountains and forgotten creek beds in the way that Real Bird does—his is a careful, astute eye that reminds us again and again of our own interrelation, of our responsibility to all beings, all places that make up our world and beyond.","M.

Henry has punched cows, worked in rodeos, and taught school from Kindergarten to college level. He began writing poetry in 1969 after an extended stay in the hospital. He still speaks Crow as his primary language and feels this has helped in writing his poetry.

4,"New Poets, Short Books, Volume IV","This fourth volume of the Lost Horse Press New Poets | Short Books series offers three strong voices, each with a personal brand of courage. Their lives are as different from one another as can be, and their sensibilities are very much their own, yet in practicing the art of poetry they share something too mysterious and vital ever to be replaced by a new technology. That is because poetry is a primary and, one might argue, primal manifestation of the life force itself. All of our brilliant inventions notwithstanding, what life feels like remains inside us. Here are three poets, each of whose personal language is part of that richness we cannot do without.","Marvin Bell",,978-0-9844510-2-9,NULL,poetry,16.95,18.95,NULL,"Marvin Bell",,new_poets_short_books_volume_iv,84,5.5,8.5,2
5,"I Go to the Ruined Place: Contemporary Poems in Defense of Global Human Rights","When we made our call for submissions for an anthology of poems in defense of human rights, the allegations of torture were foremost in our minds. We knew people were outraged, saddened, profoundly moved and ashamed. But we also wanted to reach people who had suffered violations of their own rights from circumstances across the globe, or whose families had, or for whom preventing or healing these violations had become a life's work. We drafted our call loosely: We are increasingly witness to torture, terrorisms and other violations of human rights at unprecedented degrees. What do our instincts tell us and what is our response to these violations? What is our vision of a future wherein human rights are not only respected but expanded? What we received were both first hand accounts of violation—see prisoner Adrian English's "Raped Man's Stream of Consciousness," or Farnoosh Moshiri's poem recounting the terror of giving birth in Iran, or Li-Young Lee's "Self-Help for Fellow Refugees"—and responses from people who feel struck personally by the blows enacted on others: To speak for, to speak as, and to speak against. We were surprised at the range of issues spoken to by the poets. While torture remained a critical topic, as well as issues at stake in the Iraq War, there were also poems that addressed immigrant rights, prisoners' rights, the Holocaust, the wars in Cambodia, Vietnam, Serbia, South America, Palestine and Israel. We received poems that spoke of suicide bombing, violence against women, the aftermath of 9/11, and outlawing marriage for gay Americans.</p><p>We were also moved at the range of experience among the responders: homeless advocates, civil rights workers, clinical social workers, medics, the mentally ill, veterans, humanitarian aid workers, teachers, conscientious objectors, and, of course, many writers who work and fight daily for social justice in their communities. We are particularly proud of the number of Native American poets included in this anthology, something unusual in anthologies of this sort. It seemed to us impossible to collect a group of poems on human rights issues if we didn't acknowledge the far reaching and often appalling violations that have taken place in our own country, upon the first citizens of this land who belong to five-hundred-sixty-two federally recognized tribes who function as sovereign nations. It is the acknowledgement of this history, among others, that will allow us to move forward as a country with a clearer conscience, extending our hand to other nations and other peoples who continue to endure neglect and abuse.","Melissa Kwasny &amp; M.L.

6,"In Praise","Sometime in the spring of 2007, Ray Amorosi, from whom I had not heard in twenty-five years, called and read one of my own poems into my answering machine. I called him back. He called me back. This went on for a couple of weeks until, once when he called he announced that he’d written a poem, and then he read it. It began,

God,
it’s Ray.
Thank you for the storm
that passed north of us and for the thought
of lime. Never have our
tomatoes been so sweet.
The poem just melted me and I said so. He mailed me a handwritten copy (his hands have suffered some damage and it’s hard for him to type). The following week two more arrived, and a week or so later there were two or three more. All had the totally original slant and language I remembered so well from the earlier work, but all of them, too, had this great embracing sense of gratitude for both life’s darkness and its light.

I began typing the poems as they came in, sending them back to Ray for proofing, and sometimes sending them out on his behalf to journals, where they were quickly snapped up. After some months it was clear that we had the makings of a coherent and spectacularly unusual book. This book. A phoenix of a book rising out of the ashes of long silence as though there were no tomorrow. And there isn’t; the poems say this again and again: there’s today, refreshed, troublingly and laughably bemused, trickster-ish, reverent, irreverent, glowing and infused with the world’s ironic loveliness.

"Her theme here is old and enduring love, the gnawed-at bond between longtime mates that survives epic quarrels and the creeping assault of age, and embodies a transcendent eroticism," wrote reviewer Donna Seaman in Booklist.

Her first poetry collection, <em>Between Oceans</em>, was published in 1968. "An unusual and startlingly original lyrical talent and much emotional force distinguish these poems," wrote Publishers Weekly. "A remarkable first volume of poetry."

These poems consider how both nurture and nature inform violent behaviors; how we must choose to see beauty in decay; how prayer has power even if we don’t know whom we’re addressing. Informed by the possibilities of the "American" sonnet, this sequence confronts inherent dangers in even the best-intended human gestures, and explores how we sustain faith in the face of such damage. Searching for sense in an often shattered world, limning a seam between personal and political, mining contradictions we must live within when so many people are at war, when hunger, disease and poverty are rampant, these poems forge a place where intentions and consequences are called into question; where silence is indeed profound and must be honored with apology, forgiveness and praise; and where—when facing mortality—one might sing in celebration.",,"Katrina Roberts",978-0-9800289-1-1,NULL,poetry,16.95,16.95,NULL,NULL,"Katrina Roberts, a graduate of Harvard University and the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, is a Paul Garrett Fellow and the Mina Schwabacher Associate Professor of English and the Humanities at Whitman College, where she directs the Visiting Writers Reading Series.

19,"Composing Voices: A Cycle of Dramatic Monologues","Robert Pack's new volume of poetry, <em>Composing Voices: A Cycle of Dramatic Monologues</em>, is a fabulously expanded version of his 1984 book, <em>Faces in a Single Tree</em>. In each of the poems a single person is talking to one other person to whom he is intimately related, creating deep dramatic tension: a father talking to a bereaved daughter or puzzled son; a sister confronting a sister gone astray or a brother to whom she is confessing her compromised pregnancy; husbands and wives, old and young, reviewing some crisis of their lives together. Combined with these human dramas are the dramas of nature. Pack inherits Robert Frost's sensitivity to the minutiae of spectacle and evolution, the mysteries of God and Darwin's theories. He regards these with humor and compassion. And, perhaps miraculously, but surely most wisely, he does it all within the regulations and beauties of blank verse.</p>
<p>Pack has added to his first cycle of monologues some characters who are not necessarily related by blood. Here we find relations of professional intimacy—lawyer and client, doctor and patient. All possible human concerns are excavated in these poems: humans and God, humans and the environment, humans and their most significant others, including pet monkeys and ghosts. All these characters are, of course, the creations of a single mind, that of the author's. In this new book, Pack has included a prologue and epilogue that explain his rationale for such a work of human exploration through fictional invention. His<em> Prologue</em> opens thus: "Perhaps I can convince you that I am/ quite like the other characters you'll meet / within with book—although I have a life / that's more than words where we, alas/ Dear Reader, here in this country / where bright orchestrated words are all / the measured air we can accommodate." And the "Author's Epilogue" begins thus: "Go little book, get the hell out of here, / I've had enough of these imagines lives/ invented to augment my finite own."",,"Robert Pack",978-0-9762114-0-2,NULL,poetry,20.00,25.00,NULL,NULL,"Among Robert Pack's eighteen books of poetry, his most recent collections are: <em>Elk in Winter</em> 2004), <em>Rounding It Out</em> (1999), <em>Minding the Sun</em> (1996), and <em>Fathering the Map: New and Selected Later Poems</em> (1993), all published by the University of Chicago Press. Pack's poetry focuses on such major themes as man's relationship to nature, and human intimacy—friendships and family relationships. His most recent book of criticism, <em>Belief and Uncertainty</em> in the Poetry of Robert Frost, was published in 1993 by the New England University Press, a study of Frost in the tradition of nature poetry. Pack's earlier collections of essays, <em>The Long View: Essays on the Discipline of Hope and Poetic Craft</em> and <em>Affirming Limits</em> were published by the University of Massachusetts Press. He has completed a book about Shakespeare's major plays, <em>Willing to Choose </em>, to be published in 2006.

Pack received his B.A. degree from Dartmouth College in 1951 and an M.A. from Columbia University in 1953. He taught at the New School for Social Research in New York, at Barnard College, and at Middlebury College, where he was given the Chair of Distinguished Faculty Professor of Literature and Creative Writing, a position which allowed him to teach wherever in the curriculum his interests took him. He taught literature and creative writing classes in the English Department and the Literary Studies Program and also in the Program in Environmental Studies, where his interests in psychoanalysis, Big Bang physics, and Darwinian evolution came into play. He served as the Director of the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference from l973 to 1994 and taught at Middlebury College's graduate school of English, The Bread Loaf School, for over three decades. For years Pack served the Woodrow Wilson Foundation by teaching in residence for a period of one to four weeks at various small liberal arts colleges throughout the country, most recently at Rocky Mountain College in Billings, Montana, in 2000, where he was awarded an Honorary degree in the spring of 2001.

Pack has had a Fulbright Fellowship to Italy where he translated the Mozart librettos, and has been given awards for his poetry by the National Council of the Arts, The Borestone Mountain award, the American Scholar Mary Elinor Smith Poetry Prize, and, most recently, the Mortar Board of Montana award for excellence in teaching. His poems and essays have appeared in over a hundred magazines and anthologies such as <em>American Scholar</em>, <em>The New Criterion</em>, <em>The Kenyon Review</em>, <em>The Georgia Review</em>, <em>The Yale Review</em>, and <em>The New Yorker</em>. In 1994 he was awarded the Dartmouth College medal for lifetime accomplishment and leadership.

Pack now teaches courses in Shakespeare, Romantic Poetry, Modern Poetry, Creative Writing, Visions of Nature, and Ways of Knowing at the University of Montana in Missoula in the English Department and the Honors College.

He knows we live in a world of indeterminacy, with our various ignorances and failures of language. Yet without prettying-up these conditions, his Hurry Back offers an unsentimental, clear-eyed paean to them, a kind of "elegiac lean-to/set right out in the weather because the weather’s/what there is and where we do our loving."

21,"Late at Night in the Rowboat","In these new poems, Donald Junkins again gives his readers the remarkable constructs of precision and voice and craft they have come to expect from him. His formal poise and meditative music convey the reader through highly particularized places and times to numinous Place and Time, always lingering at the crossroads of landscape and inscape. Retracing paths of memory, Junkins leads his readers toward the harbor of true placidity where, through the larger motions of the heart, we stand a chance of loving well the world.

In these poems there may be "homesickness"—or mal du pays, for many homes, many places, many countries, many times, but they will have no truck with mere nostalgia, that sentimental drive to surrender the present to the past. What the poet creates brilliantly here is the essential poetic archeology, sifting the ruins of the past to make sense of the present, and thus an imaginable future.

Readers will discover in these landscapes that are at once achingly real and hauntingly magical, both loss and grace, and renewals that redeem remorse and regret. With something very much like prayerful reverence for exactitude and truth, these poems do what Bergson says art must do—they bring us into our own presence.",H.R.Stoneback,"Donals Junkins",978-0-9717265-8-1,NULL,poetry,16.00,25.00,NULL,NULL," Donald Junkins is a winner of the New Letters poetry award, and has been the recipient of two National Endowment for the Arts grants.

22,"At the Edge of the Western Wave"," What I love about this collection is that it catches perfectly that special sense of rural Ireland which might be described as mixture of raw satirical humour, tragedy, and a kind of yearning for love and connection in a society that feels a constant tension between materialism and spirituality. <em>At the Edge of the Western Wave</em> is a big and sweeping enough collection to be able to accomodate these themes and their nuances: I'm constantly amazed at the way in which Reyes can present a small detail--a shop-front, a "wink" of light, an Hiberno-English phrase, a name, a place name--and evoke a whole way of life.
 
"What's even more important, though, is that there's a clear sense of Reyes as a poet making his way through the shoals of Irish sensibility, first as a stranger with a stranger's alert, even amazed, eye, but later as someone who has become strangely at home in the west of Ireland, but still not losing his alertness for the lyricism of the quotidian.

After college in Berkeley and San Francisco, he lived on the Big Sur and Mendocino coasts, working as a “wood butcher,” building houses, and salvaging redwood logs. Torre later went north to settle on a remote homestead in the Canadian Rockies with his wife and two daughters, scratching a living from livestock and sawmills. Eventually, he moved south to Point Reyes, California, then to the Great Basin high desert, where he now lives on a small ranch at the base of the Warner Mountains.

Given his priority for living in raw and untamed country, Torre’s poems are seldom without reference to wild landscape.

What is missed in subtlety is made up for by the wider range of vision. From up high and far behind you can see more than the stage, and some of the more interesting moments take place in the margins. Not only do you see the sets, but you see them being built; not only do you see the stars, but you see the reflectors that give them light. In this first collection, Poole looks into the wings, noticing the story behind the story. His poems concern not his friend who goes crazy, but the reaction of those close to him. For him, the chimneys of a distant community look like cemetary stones, and they take his thoughts beyond the here and now. He doesn't have to know a New York woman to imagine one: "long hair/ they are always combing,/ thick hair that gets loose/ and crawls down the skyscraper."

A sensitivity quivering with the terror and joy of existence inhabits this poetry. A man temporarily abandons replacing a broken automobile starter to savor "the perfection of babies." Another realizes that living beings posses a power such "that death / can't completely inhabit the body." Poole's words would convince anyone that our species will endure and triumph. Humorous, thoughtful, and vibrating with magic, the poems of Hiding from Salesmen are simultaneously vehicle, idea, organic compound and music.

35,"The Art of Absence","Like Passanante's other work, the stories in this volume are moving because of their humanity and the beauty of the writing. I felt that each story was a visit to a different room in the house of the soul (though there are doors between the rooms and influences move from one to another). Passanante's writing is sensuous, in its concreteness, its imagery, and the descriptions of sensation and feeling. It is also precise--I never found an unnecessary or a not-quite-right word. The characters are sexual, and Passanate's writing is wonderfully honest about the complexity of sexual feeling and expression. Sexuality is also their medium of expression, and the complexity of experience is reflected in the complexity of the characters' sexual feeling and behavior. There is much wit, and there is also tragedy. This is one of those writers who, even in her more gothic moments, describes a human being in a way that makes you recognize, sometimes reluctantly, some secret in yourself.

There's wit, variety, and imaginative boldness in this collection of stories, as well as a pleasurable richness of detail that captures different social, geographical, and natural environments with precision and grace. That attunement to place--whether the nursery downstairs from the Middle America bowling lanes or the TriBeCa restaurant with its trendy menu-of-the-minute--conveys not only the world these characters inhabit, but their consuming, poignant hunger. Though the overt subject of most of these stories is passion that transgresses the boundaries of marriage and of other familial and professional codes, what the characters act out in surprising, creative, and sometimes terrifying ways are the hopes and unforeseen consequences of the post-war suburban dream of the perfect place, the home that will satisfy every need and settle all questions. Children of the migrations that brought their grandparents from Europe and their parents from the city, Passanante's characters, planted in an Eden meant to end desire, find themselves dreaming of other places, of cities, of the East (whether Boston or India), of transient apartments and hotels--and of other houses, houses that, no matter how familiar their mass-produced design, might just become, contain, or conceal some unknown and absolutely necessary secret ungraspable at home--perhaps that life unlived while the dreamers passed their own youth in striving to act out their parents' dreams. So these transgressive characters break into houses, or break through their own walls with power tools--and, when they can't do either, peer in from the wrong side of nighttime windows. For readers, these stories themselves are windows onto the unspoken reality behind the cultural promises of that time, revealing the often violent and always irreducible mystery of injustice haunting those model homes, compelling the children who grew up in them to betrayals that may only be efforts to make some sense of a guilt that precedes any crime: the guilt of being human.",,"Joy Passanante",978-0-9717265-4-3,NULL,fiction,16.95,NULL,NULL,NULL,">Joy

The theme echoes the way that the rape of nature and the rape of women were simultaneously justified in many pseudo-Christian cultures under the traditional droit du seigneur, the right of the bleeder—the "señor," "sir" or "sire"—to claim whatever is virginal for his own profit and pleasure.",,"Pierre Delattre",978-0-9668612-5-9,NULL,fiction,15.95,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Pierre Delattre is a writer and painter living in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in northern New Mexico. <em>Tales of a Dalai Lama</em> was his first book of fiction, followed by <em>Walking On Air</em>; <em>Episodes</em>, a memoir; and, most recently, a book of essays, <em>The Art of Beauty</em>.

41,"Willing To Choose: Volition & Storytelling in Shakespeare's Major Plays","This book is intended for the reader and theater-goer who loves Shakespeare’s plays and enjoys contemplating them in their complexity: the richness of metaphorical language, the characters’ psychological depths and dimensions, the philosophical implications of the plays as organic dramatic entities that testify to the nature of human limitation and human freedom. I assume that the reader has the patience to delight in the minute details of Shakespeare’s patterns of imagery as well as to admire the overall structure of the plays. What most interests me is how these plays cohere and how they can be read from different perspectives which nevertheless complement each other. Thus, I have not adopted any single critical approach, but have responded to each play’s individual identity with what seem to me appropriate and fruitful interpretative points of view. Blessed in having been enfranchised by my profession to teach Shakespeare for half a century, I wish to share with my readers the humane vision I find everywhere in Shakespeare’s incomparable plays—a vision empathetic to human suffering and moral aspiration, tempered by his acute awareness of human frailty, which has immeasurably enriched my own life.","Author’s Note to the Reader","Robert Pack",978-0-9762114-4-0,NULL,nonfiction,18.00,NULL,NULL,NULL,"The author of twenty books of his own poetry, the most recent being <em>Elk in Winter</em> and <a href="composing.html"><em>Composing Voices</em></a>, and five books of literary criticism, Robert Pack finds everywhere in Shakespeare’s incomparable plays a vision empathetic to human suffering and moral aspiration, tempered by the Bard’s acute awareness of human frailty.

42,"Finding the Top of the Sky","In James Grabill’s unique view no one should settle for a world that conducts itself as though there were no mythic dimension; his other collection of essays and his many stunning books of poems make this clear. But unlike many American writers critical of the way this world we shouldn’t settle for is going, Grabill has the visionary skill to give us a glimpse of how it should be going. In the face of the escalating inanity and aridness of post-industrial life, the fine pieces in this volume insist that compassion triumph over cruelty, meditative clarity over bombast and spin. It is a great delight to feel the weight of Grabill’s conviction (along with his immense talent) and, with sea lions, lorikeets, giant ferns, and humpback whales, to follow it to the top of the sky, where it is so much easier to see what matters and what does not.","Christopher Howell","James Grabill",978-0-9717265-7-4,NULL,nonfiction,16.95,25.95,NULL,NULL,"James Grabill was born in Ohio and attended The College of Wooster,
